** Entry test - DSC 305 "Machine Learning"
*** README

We're going to use the statistical programming language R in this
course. Some proficiency with R is assumed though we'll review the
basics at the start.

If you're new to R, I suggest you complete the (free) "[[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r][Introduction to
R]]" course on the DataCamp platform - this will take about 4 hours of
your time. The course is free - you only have to register with
DataCamp (please use your Lyon email for that).

This entry test covers some of the basics:
1. R data structures
2. Managing data with R
3. Exploring and understanding data using R

To work through the test, open this [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FiCejT-5WwsnRcyB7OPfDcP0X-1HwFFi?usp=sharing][notebook in Google
Colaboratory]][fn:1] and answer the questions by adding code in the code
blocks and running them one by one as shown [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ml/blob/main/img/colab2.png][in this figure]].

Alternatively, you can work through [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/ml/main/org/entrytest.org][this Org-mode file]] using Emacs.

*** R data structures

1) Create a vector named ~subject_name~ to store three patient names,
   John Doe, Jane Doe, and Steve Graves.
   #+begin_src R :results silent
     
   #+end_src

2) Display the content of ~subject_name~ in five different ways (you
   should know at least two ways to do this).
   #+begin_src R
     
   #+end_src

3) What type of vector is ~subject_name~? 
   #+begin_src R
     
   #+end_src

* Footnotes

[fn:1] If you want to start a new R notebook in Google Colaboratory,
you need to enter ~https://colab.to/r~. For an explanation on how to use
Python + R in this environment, [[https://youtu.be/XasBV68Szk4][see here]]. In the course, we're going
to do literate programming with GNU Emacs + ESS + Org-mode
instead. Colaboratory, RStudio, or DataCamp workspace are all
alternative IDEs. However, none of them give us the freedom and
control that Emacs gives us.
