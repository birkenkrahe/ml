* Objectives

This course is concerned with algorithms that transform information
into actionable intelligence using present-day computers and big
data. We use R, a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming
environment that combines a wide range of functions, interfaces to
common machine learning packages, and best-in-class visualization.

* Student learning outcomes

Students who complete DSC 305, "Machine Learning" (ML), can:

- Apply un/supervised learning models to big data problems
- Understand neural networks and Support Vector Machine algorithms
- Distinguish different methods to make predictions with ML
- Work with open source libraries like ~Keras~ and ~TensorFlow~ by Google
- Master the whole infrastructure for advanced statistical computing
- Know how to effectively present assignment results
- Improve data literacy, research and present a project as a team

* Course requirements

- Basic proficiency with R is useful (as taught in DSC 105 or obtained
  independently on DataCamp "Introduction to R", GitHub's "fasteR", or
  Part I of the Book of R by Davies)
- Imagination, creativity and a visual mind, enjoying finding patterns
  and spotting correlations
- Basic understanding of algorithms and data structures (in any
  programming language)
- Basic understanding of data science infrastructure especially
  literate programming methods

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter
grades. for the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs,
while for the term results, only straight letters are given (by
rounding up).

* Schedule and session content

For *important dates*, see the 2022-2023 Academic Calendar at:
[[https://catalog.lyon.edu/202223-academic-calendar][catalog.lyon.edu/202223-academic-calendar]]

Lectures and lab sessions are aligned with the content of the 10
*DataCamp lessons* that need to be completed in the course of the
term. The last four sessions are devoted to deep learning without
(graded) assignments.
