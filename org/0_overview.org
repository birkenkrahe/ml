What do you think "machine learning" is about?
- Creating a predictive model for complicated data
- AI
- Chappie movie - sentient robots
- Training neural networks
- Self-checkout with automatic fraud detection
- To see how a computer system works
- ChatGPT - "Generative Pre-trained Transformer" = chatbot

- Autonomous vehicles


* Why is machine learning important?

What do you think - is machine learning important? Why or why not?

- *Automate* human jobs (speed and accuracy) - not "normal robots"
- Double-edge sword for *security* (hackers)
- Use for *problem-solving* (e.g. teaching a car how to park but issues
  with transferability and memory)
- *Decision-making* independent of simple (computational) problem
  solving

#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Scrum sprint review and IMRaD publishing framework
[[../img/0_scrum.png]]

- Scrum is an important software engineering technique

- IMRaD is an important framework to publish scientific papers

#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+Caption: Type of projects on offer
[[../img/0_project.png]]

- All projects are 3-people group projects - 7 projects in total

- Let me know what kind of project you'd like to work on this term!

- Turn to your neighbor(s) and discuss with them

- Fill in a post-it note and/or vote on existing notes: go to
  [[https://tinyurl.com/2s38bdtk][tinyurl.com/2s38bdtk]]:
  1) I can give you a project topic to work on - IF SO, WHY?
  2) Or you can pick your own project topic - IF SO, WHY?
  3) You can do the work and present the results in class - IF SO, WHY?
  4) Or you can write an essay instead - IF SO, WHY?

* Project examples

*Examples for projects chosen by me:*
- Work through, check and present a research article given to you
- Create and/or present a case study on one of my topics
- Explain my choice of concept or method with applications

*Examples for projects chosen by yourself:*
- Use an ML method on a dataset of your choice
- Pick your own research article to study and present
- Pick a concept or method with applications and explain it

*Essays:* you can use ChatGPT as long as you're open about it (quote it
to avoid plagiarization) and can survive a cross-examination on the
material.

*Concrete examples:* Analyse, test and present

- [[https://github.com/matloff/fastStat][fastStat by Norman Matloff (GitHub)]] - fast lane to statistics (*new!*)

(I might give an introduction to R in a biostatistics course.)

* Literate Programming
 #+attr_latex: :width 400px
 #+caption: Literate Programming with GNU Emacs (illustration)
 [[../img/0_gnuemacs1.png]]

If you do not have any experience with Emacs, work through the *online
tutorial* (open it in Emacs with ~CTRL + h t~) - ca. 1 hour.
- Learn to open/close the editor
- Learn basic cursor control (moving around)
- Learn basic file management (open/close/find/save files)
- Learn basic windows (buffer) management

*Visit me during office hours to get a personal introduction to Emacs.*

* Course textbook
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
#+caption: Book cover, ML with R 3rd ed. by Brett Lantz (Packt, 2019)
[[../img/0_lantz.png]]

- Get the 2019 textbook by [[https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-r-third-edition/9781788295864][Lantz, Machine Learning with R (3e)]] and
  read the first chapter (it's free even without buying it).

- I'm working through it myself. One assigned DataCamp course is by
  the same author, who is now senior data scientist at SONY
  Playstation.

- "Cookbook" machine learning books present only the recipes but
  offer no serious explanation. Same for many Kaggle projects -
  code only.

- I usually work with 3-10 different books but I keep coming back
  to the best ones that I have really worked through. Another good
  idea: pick a mathematical text on machine learning

* Linux
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Conversation with ChatGPT by OpenAI
[[../img/0_ml_chatgpt_3.png]]

Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your PC, then learn
the command line with [[https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php][Shotts' book (5e, 2023)]].

Caveat: several ML packages did not install under WSL Ubuntu 22 -
however, they do install in Google Colaboratory for R
(https://colab.to/r).
