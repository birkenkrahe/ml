A little bit of math in here, but nothing more than basic
arithmetic. The main complexity is to understand the relationship
between features, class, and probability measures, which are our
"similarity" measure for this type of classifier.

<p>
The estimated likelihood of an <b>event</b> or potential outcome is based on
the evidence from multiple <b>trials</b> or opportunities for the event to
occur.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The more trials the better for the accuracy of the estimate - by way
of the <b>law of large numbers</b>: if you repeat an experiment independently
a large number of times and average the result, your result is close to
the expected value (the arithmetic mean):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Large number of coin flips - P(head) = P(tail) = 50%</li>
<li>Large number of observed days - weather averages</li>
<li>Large number of email messages - certain spam prediction</li>
<li>Large number of elections - certain presidential prediction</li>
<li>Large number of lottery tickets - certain win</li>

</ul>

<p>
But: real events are never mathematically independent.

In email trials, spam and ham are mutually exclusive and exhaustive
events.

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>P(event) = no. of occurrences / no. of trials</li>
<li>Rain on 3/10 days w/similar conditions: 30% prob today</li>
<li>Adding all P =&gt; 100% of the data or &sum; P(event)=1 because a trial
always results in an outcome.</li>
<li>P(spam) + P(ham) = 1 implies that spam/ham <b>mutually exclusive and
exhaustive</b>.</li>
<li>An alternative way of saying this uses a table of records: if you
record many, many instances, say 1000, you have 200 lines marked as
'spam' and 800 lines marked as 'ham'.</li>

Calculating P(spam &cap; Viagra) depends on the joint probabilities of the
two events, on their <b>dependency</b>. 
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The Venn diagram illustrates instances that are only spam, only
Viagra but not spam and spam with Viagra messages.</li>
<li>Named after 19th century mathematician John Venn</li>
<li>If the circles aren't touching, the joint prob is 0 and the events
are said to be <b>independent</b>. They can still occur simultaneously.</li>
<li>A &cap; B = 0: Knowing something about the outcome of A reveals nothing
about the outcome of B. Hard to illustrate in the real world, but:</li>
<li>The outcome of a coin flip is unlikely to depend on the weather
being sunny or rainy on any given day.</li>
<li><b>Dependent events are the basis of predictive modeling.</b></li>
<li>The appearance of clouds is predictive of rain, the appearance of
the word 'Viagra' is predictive of spam.</li>

<ul>
<li>Recall: we're trying to predict the chance that a message that
contains the word 'Viagra' (B) is spam (A).</li>
<li>The formula states that the best estimate of P(A|B) is the
proportion of trials in which A occurred with B, P(A &cap; B), out of
all trials in which B occurred (all 'Viagra' messages).</li>
<li>Extreme cases: if B is very rare, P(B) is small and the correction
to P(A) is negligible (independence)</li>
<li>If A and B occur together very often, P(A|B) will be high regardless
of P(B).</li>
<li>If Viagra and spam were independent, P(A &cap; B) = 0.05 * 0.20 = 0.01</li>

To calculate the components, construct a frequency table that records
how often 'Viagra' appeared in 'spam' and 'ham' messages.

<ul>
<li>Without knowing anything about an incoming messages, our best
estimate would be P(spam) - the <b>prior probability</b> (20%)</li>
<li>The chance of having any 'Viagra' in a spam message is the <b>marginal
likelihood</b> - having any 'Viagra' at all is the <b>marginal likelihood</b></li>
<li>What we're after is a computation of the <b>posterior probability</b>

<p>
The rows of the likelihood table contain the conditional probabilities
for "Viagra" (yes/no) given that an email was spam or ham:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org6ef36f6">
P(Viagra = Yes | spam) = 4/20 = 0.20
P(spam &amp; Viagra) = P(Viagra|spam) * P(spam) = (4/20)*(20/100) = 0.04
P(spam|Viagra) = (4/20) * (20/100) / (5/100) = 0.80
</pre>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The computed chance of getting spam AND Viagra is FOUR times as
large as the chance when independence was assumed
(P(Viagra)*P(spam)=0.01)</li>
<li>The posterior probability that a message containing Viagra is spam
is 80% - any message containing this term should be filtered.</li>
<li>This is how commercial spam filters work: they consider a much
larger number of words simultaneously when computing frequency and
likelihood tables.</li>
<li>The Naive Bayes algorithm accounts for these additional
difficulties. It also relies on careful text pre-processing of the
message data.</li>
