A little bit of math in here, but nothing more than basic
arithmetic. The main complexity is to understand the relationship
between features, class, and probability measures, which are our
"similarity" measure for this type of classifier.

The estimated likelihood of an <b>event</b> or potential outcome is based on
the evidence from multiple <b>trials</b> or opportunities for the event to
occur.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The more trials the better for the accuracy of the estimate - by way
of the <b>law of large numbers</b>: if you repeat an experiment independently
a large number of times and average the result, your result is close to
the expected value (the arithmetic mean):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Large number of coin flips - P(head) = P(tail) = 50%</li>
<li>Large number of observed days - weather averages</li>
<li>Large number of email messages - certain spam prediction</li>
<li>Large number of elections - certain presidential prediction</li>
<li>Large number of lottery tickets - certain win</li>

</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The question is always what we want to classify: if we're after
spam, some features are more <b>important</b> than others, e.g. the email
sender or the subject line. Words in the message body are not
<b>independent</b> from one another - e.g. "Viagra" will be accompanied by
"drugs", "cash" by "free" etc.
</p>

<p>
If we analyze for sentiment (categories: good, bad, neutral, etc.)
in online reviews, then length of the review is more <b>important</b> than
the (anonymous) sender. The sentiment features are not <b>independent</b>
of the time of the review - it is related to the product launch
time, the time of day, etc.
</p>

<p>
NB performs well even when these assumptions are violated, even if
there are strong feature dependencies, especially with smaller
datasets. The exact reason for this success is not known.

<p>
As new messages are received, we need to calculate the posterior
probability to determine whether they are more likely spam or ham,
given the likelihood of the words being found in the message text.
</p>

<p>
Computational complexity is enormous: probabilities for possible
intersecting events need to be stored. Imagine the Venn diagram of
four overlapping circles - in reality, we have hundreds of features.

| Exhaustive events         | Events cover all possible events               |
| Joint probability         | Chance for events to happen together           |
| Independent events        | Joint probability is zero                      |
| Dependent events          | Conditional probability is non-zero            |
| Bayes' Theorem (simple)   | P(A \vert B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B)                     |
| Bayes' Theorem (complete) | P(A \vert B) = P(B \vert A) * P(A) / P(B)              |
