»Look, I *remember* when AI used to involve math, maybe not Actual
Mathematician Math, but at least nontrivial computer science.  Modern
deep learning is calculus for bright eleven-year-olds, plus the first
five pages of a linear algebra textbook, plus a six-month
apprenticeship in incompressible alchemical best practices whose lack
of principled rationale also deprives them of relevance to macroscopic
issues, plus having a billion dollars to spend on training runs.«

* Summary

- Supervised ML methods (kNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Linear and
  Logistic Regression) result in clear understanding of the
  relationships between the input and the output.

- Unsupervised ANN ML methods are extremely powerful as classifiers
  that can be applied in both categorical and numeric prediction
  problems but they result in nearly-incomprehensible models.
