** Google search for programmers (Goldin, 2023)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Google search tutorial by Seth Goldin (freeCodeCamp)
[[../img/goldin.png]]

Waste of time?
1) Searching is not finding
2) Finding is not understanding
3) Understanding is not using

*Google's business model = data + algorithm + infrastructure + brand*
1) data are offered by users for free
2) algorithm is largely known and public
3) infrastructure is proprietary and hard to duplicate
4) brand is unique and highly valuable (but also vulnerable)

ChatGPT's answer to "how do I search using Google effectively?"
#+begin_quote
Here are a few tips for searching effectively using Google:

1. Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase. For
   example, searching for ~"chocolate chip cookies"~ will return pages
   that include that exact phrase, rather than pages that include the
   words ~"chocolate"~, ~"chip"~, and ~"cookies"~ separately.

2. Use a minus sign to exclude certain words from your search. For
   example, searching for ~chocolate chip cookies -recipe~ will return
   pages that include ~chocolate chip cookies~ but exclude any pages
   that include the word "~recipe~".

3. Use the ~site:~ operator to search within a specific website. For
   example, searching for ~site:nytimes.com chocolate chip cookies~ will
   return pages on the New York Times website that include the words
   "~chocolate chip cookies~."

4. Use the ~filetype:~ operator to search for specific file types. For
   example, searching for chocolate chip cookies ~filetype:pdf~ will
   return PDF documents that include the words "~chocolate chip
   cookies~".

5. Use the ~related:~ operator to find websites that are related to a
   specific website. For example, searching for ~related:nytimes.com~
   will return websites that are related to the New York Times
   website.

6. Use the Google [[https://www.google.com/advanced_search][advanced search page]] for more complex queries.

Keep in mind that Google's search algorithm is constantly evolving, so
these tips may not always return the most accurate results.

** DONE [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1021/discussion_topics/2125][Jan 26 session online]]
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

** DONE Doctor, Doctor!
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/couch.jpg]]

- ~M-x doctor~

** DONE Project - first sprint review (Tuesday, Feb 13)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.jpg]]

- The term project purpose is down to you - or you can approach me for
  an idea (but please do that sooner than later)!

- There are many different ways to present a paper or a slide pack:
  e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

- Your first deliverable is a *project proposal* formatted as an
  Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

  1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
     (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

  2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
     ~Metrics~, ~References~

     - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

     - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

     - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
       do you foresee right now?

     - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
       achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
       list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
       your project.

     - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

     - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
       sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
       (author, date, title, place).

- Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 13*). Missing
  the deadline will cost you points.

** DONE Condition for repeating tests
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Late or missed the test? Talk to me!
[[../img/late.jpg]]

- If you inform me beforehand that you cannot attend an announced
  test, we can make arrangements for you to take the test outside of
  class.

** DONE [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1021/assignments/6737/edit?quiz_lti][Test 1 review]]
** DONE How should you study for data science tests?
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/studying.jpg]]

- If you were successful in the test: what did you do?
- If not: what do you think you should have done?

* Week 4 - Icestorm
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/icestorm.jpg]]

* Week 5 - ML models overview & Review of R (Part III)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/ml_types2.png]]

** DONE Upload practice files 2 GDrive (or 2 stick)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/gdrive.png]]

#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/sticks.jpeg]]

- Make a bootable Linux stick (e.g. [[https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html][Linux Mint]]), too

** DONE Create an ~.Rprofile~

- Create or open ~~/.Rprofile~ and add these lines to it:
  #+begin_example R
  options(repos=c("https://cloud.r-project.org/"))
  options(crayon.enabled = FALSE)
  message("*** Loaded .Rprofile ***")
  #+end_example

- Save the file and start an R console to test it (you should also see
  the ~Loaded~ message:
  #+begin_src R
    options()$repos
  #+end_src

- From now on, Windows will no longer ask you to choose a mirror site,
  and you will be able to display a "~tibble~" (a sort of data frame
  popular in the "Tidyverse") in Emacs:
  #+begin_src R :results output
    library(MASS)
    tibble(mtcars)
  #+end_src

** DONE Test 2 opens Friday - closes Tuesday Feb 14
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Image by Grovemade via Unsplash.com
[[../img/homeoffice.jpg]]

- This test will be about machine learning models (lecture) and about
  the review of R (in-class assignment).

- You can complete the test at your leisure (within the set time
  limit) but you must complete it before the deadline (Tue-14-Feb)

* READ Understanding R startup
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

[[../img/rstartup.jpeg]]

[[https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/19/r-for-enterprise-understanding-r-s-startup/][Here is an article]] (Lopp, 2019) on R startup variables and
settings. Includes an explanation why the ~.Rprofile~ startup file was
not read when some of you opened the R console in the shell (you
should probably try ~Rgui~ on the command line, too).
