** Google search for programmers (Goldin, 2023)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

Waste of time?
1) Searching is not finding
2) Finding is not understanding
3) Understanding is not using

*Google's business model = data + algorithm + infrastructure + brand*
1) data are offered by users for free
2) algorithm is largely known and public
3) infrastructure is proprietary and hard to duplicate
4) brand is unique and highly valuable (but also vulnerable)

ChatGPT's answer to "how do I search using Google effectively?"
#+begin_quote
Here are a few tips for searching effectively using Google:

1. Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase. For
   example, searching for ~"chocolate chip cookies"~ will return pages
   that include that exact phrase, rather than pages that include the
   words ~"chocolate"~, ~"chip"~, and ~"cookies"~ separately.

2. Use a minus sign to exclude certain words from your search. For
   example, searching for ~chocolate chip cookies -recipe~ will return
   pages that include ~chocolate chip cookies~ but exclude any pages
   that include the word "~recipe~".

3. Use the ~site:~ operator to search within a specific website. For
   example, searching for ~site:nytimes.com chocolate chip cookies~ will
   return pages on the New York Times website that include the words
   "~chocolate chip cookies~."

4. Use the ~filetype:~ operator to search for specific file types. For
   example, searching for chocolate chip cookies ~filetype:pdf~ will
   return PDF documents that include the words "~chocolate chip
   cookies~".

5. Use the ~related:~ operator to find websites that are related to a
   specific website. For example, searching for ~related:nytimes.com~
   will return websites that are related to the New York Times
   website.

6. Use the Google [[https://www.google.com/advanced_search][advanced search page]] for more complex queries.

Keep in mind that Google's search algorithm is constantly evolving, so
these tips may not always return the most accurate results.

1) Most popular OS for ML?

2) Which tools are we using in this course?

3) What are the deliverables for your project?

4) Where do you get the topic for your term project?

5) What are the steps for a supervised learning process?

6) What is the general ML process?

** DONE Project - first sprint review (Tuesday, Feb 7)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.jpg]]

- The term project purpose is down to you - or you can approach me for
  an idea (but please do that sooner than later)!

- There are many different ways to present a paper or a slide pack:
  e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

- Your first deliverable is a *project proposal* formatted as an
  Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

  1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
     (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

  2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
     ~Metrics~, ~References~

     - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

     - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

     - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
       do you foresee right now?

     - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
       achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
       list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
       your project.

     - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

     - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
       sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
       (author, date, title, place).

- Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 7, 12 pm*). Missing
  the deadline will cost you points.

** DONE Condition for repeating tests
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Late or missed the test? Talk to me!
[[../img/late.jpg]]

- If you inform me beforehand that you cannot attend an announced
  test, we can make arrangements for you to take the test outside of
  class.

** DONE [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1021/assignments/6737/edit?quiz_lti][Test 1 review]]
** DONE How should you study for data science tests?

- If you were successful in the test: what did you do?
- If not: what do you think you should have done?
