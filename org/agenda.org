Waste of time?
1) Searching is not finding
2) Finding is not understanding
3) Understanding is not using

Google's business model = data + algorithm + infrastructure + brand
1) data are offered by users for free
2) algorithm is largely known and public
3) infrastructure is proprietary and hard to duplicate
4) brand is unique and highly valuable (but also vulnerable)

ChatGPT's answer to "how do I search using Google effectively?"
#+begin_quote
Here are a few tips for searching effectively using Google:

1. Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase. For
   example, searching for ~"chocolate chip cookies"~ will return pages
   that include that exact phrase, rather than pages that include the
   words ~"chocolate"~, ~"chip"~, and ~"cookies"~ separately.

2. Use a minus sign to exclude certain words from your search. For
   example, searching for ~chocolate chip cookies -recipe~ will return
   pages that include ~chocolate chip cookies~ but exclude any pages
   that include the word "~recipe~".

3. Use the ~site:~ operator to search within a specific website. For
   example, searching for ~site:nytimes.com chocolate chip cookies~ will
   return pages on the New York Times website that include the words
   "~chocolate chip cookies~."

4. Use the ~filetype:~ operator to search for specific file types. For
   example, searching for chocolate chip cookies ~filetype:pdf~ will
   return PDF documents that include the words "~chocolate chip
   cookies~".

5. Use the ~related:~ operator to find websites that are related to a
   specific website. For example, searching for ~related:nytimes.com~
   will return websites that are related to the New York Times
   website.

6. Use the Google [[https://www.google.com/advanced_search][advanced search page]] for more complex queries.

Keep in mind that Google's search algorithm is constantly evolving, so
these tips may not always return the most accurate results.
