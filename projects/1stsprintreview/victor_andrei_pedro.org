#+TITLE: Linear Regression and Random Forest Model from SKlearn
#+AUTHOR: Victor Noppe, Andrei Galca, and Pedro Mota
#+SUBTITLE: Sprint review one

* Problem

  Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
  
* Reason

  To get a better understanding of how machine learning models work
  and how to evaluate their accuracy.
  
* Constraints

  1. Since the team is currently working on multiple projects, time to
  meet will be a challenge to overcome.
  
  2. Limited experience with Python.

  3. Limited experience with Machine Learning.
  
* Goals and Non-goals
** Goals

   1. To better understand Machine Learning and how Machine Learning
      models are implemented.

   2. To create an engaging and informative presentation.

   3. To be abble to illustrate the comparison between Linear
      Regression and Random Forest (non-linear regression) models in a
      clear and understandable manner.
   
** Non-goals

   1. Becoming more confortable with presenting from a professional
      standpoint.

   2. Becoming more familiar with Python.
   
* Plan

  1. Complete the youtube guide found for this project.

  2. Meet on a regular basis to discuss the research found on Linear
     Regression model and Random Forest Model.

  3. Help each other obtain the same confort with the proposed topic
     for this project.

  4. Find literature to help develop and reinforce the topic of our
     project.
  
* Metrics

  1. The amount of knowledge we are able to obtain and relay to or classmates.

  2. How engaged our classmates are with our presentation.

  3. Were we able to fit the presentation to the allotted time frame.   

  4. The overall grade we obtain for this project.
  
* Questions

  
  1. Is this a valid idea for a project?

  2. What is the proper citation for the emacs and org-mode software?

  3. Are there any source that you could recommend on Linear
     Regression models and Random Forest models?
