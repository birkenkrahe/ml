#+NAME: AI Art Without Artists
#+begin_example
Audry S, Ippolito J. "Can Artificial Intelligence Make Art without
Artists? Ask the Viewer." Arts. 2019;
8(1):35.[[https://doi.org/10.3390/arts8010035][doi.org]]

Summary/Achieve: This paper addresses whether machines can be artists and
suggests that the viewer should decide. They expand on Cohen's AARON,
a machine that cannot deter from the rules set or change its
constraints and therefore, cannot be creative. Additionally, the paper
compares this line of reasoning to Leonel Moura, an artist who works
with an army of mobile robots who make drawings. Moura claims that
once the robots are taught how to paint, they move on their own. They
discuss authorship of art and assigning personality to the
meta-artist. They conclude by focusing on the role of artists and
viewers of machine-generated art.

Relevance: Medium, Intro/Discussion (collab, history, current use)

Evaluation: I thought that the mentioning of AI music compositions was
fascinating. Also, I enjoyed learning about Naruto et al. versus David
Slater and how a robot can learn until they no longer relate to what
the coder initially meant for the robot to do. I'd recommended this
reading for those who want to know more about AI art controversies.

Credibility: High(scholarly journal article, extensive citations,
Ippolito is a well-published author and educator)

#+NAME: AI Haikus
#+begin_example
Hitsuwari, Jimpei, et al. "Does human-AI collaboration lead to more
creative art? Aesthetic evaluation of human-made and AI-generated
haiku poetry." Computers in Human Behavior, 2022,
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107502][doi.org]]

Summary/Achieve: The paper expands on AI-generated poetry, and how people
react to a machine's writing. Their study found that when humans and
AI collaborated, those haikus were chosen by the study group to be the
most beautiful. Those in the study could not tell the difference
between human-made and AI-generated haikus. The study group also were
given tests to measure animism traits, empathy levels, interest in
haiku and art, and sensitivity to similarity, all of which were taken
into consideration. They conclude that creativity can be boosted when
humans and machines work together.

Relevance: Low (Possible Methods, transfer haiku from chat gpt to ceramics)

Evaluation: It was an interesting read; I like how they were very methodological in their study of haiku and beauty and how thorough they were in analyzing statistical significance. It was also interesting how beauty scores have not had significant differences even when the culture in the study changes. I would recommend it to those who like poetry and those interested in AI-generated text.

#+NAME: AICAN Creativity
#+begin_example
Mazzone M, Elgammal A. Art, "Creativity, and the Potential of
Artificial Intelligence." Arts. 2019;
8(1):26.[[https://doi.org/10.3390/arts8010026][doi.org]]

Summary/Achieve: Art is constantly being redefined and boundaries of the
subject reimagined. This paper goes into detail about algorithmic art,
where an algorithm learns aesthetics from input images to generate new
images.The two researchers of this article use their knowledge of art
history and computer science to argue that human and machine
creativity can work alongside each other and not always be competing
when it comes to making art. Through one of their studies, they found
that people could not tell the difference between machine and human
generated art. They emphasize that the AICAN system is designed to
deviate from copying the images they learn from and to instead
encourage new versions of art.

Relevance: Medium, Intro (human and machine partnership)

Evaluation: I liked how they included the role of the artist in the
pre-curation, tweaking of the algorithm, and post-curation steps of
the art generating process. I enjoyed their discussion of how failure
cases can still have a visually positive impact on the viewer. I would
recommend this reading for those interested in how machines and
artists can work together to create AI generated art.

#+NAME: Ceramics and Print
#+begin_example
Scott, Paul. Ceramics and Print. University of Pennsylvania
Press, 2002.

Summary/Achieve: This book outlines the history of ceramics and print. From
wooden prints, to stamps, to lithography to screen printing and
photography, the book highlights techniques to transfer designs and
images onto ceramic pieces. The author also discusses recent
developments in printing on ceramics and industrial uses.

Relevance: Medium, Methods (options for transferring ink to clay)

Evaluation: I really enjoyed reading about all the different methods
that have been explored over the years and looking at the images of
prints. I found the fact that ceramic photographs are common at
graveyards to be particularly interesting. I would have liked it if he
went into more detail about UV curing media and the machinery
(hardware and software) that is being developed for industrial use. I
would recommend this reading for ceramicists interested in design work
or those who want to know more about the history of and correlation
between ceramics and print.

Credibility: Medium(book, written by accomplished artist)
