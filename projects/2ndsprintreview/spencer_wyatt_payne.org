* Literture Search Strategy

We started by searching for some general articles about how to build a
 snake game and neural networks

1) Using supervised learning to teach a network to play battleship 
(https://medium.com/@jayceesansom/using-supervised-training-to-teach-a-network-to-play-battleship-7522f28c52ca) 

  Summary:
   This article discusses the author's experience in using supervised training
   to teach a neural network how to play the game of Battleship. The author
   also explains how he created a dataset of game states and corresponding 
   actions for the neural network to learn from.

  Evaluation:
   This is one of the early articles we found that is focused around battleship
   but still in the realm of this of this project


2) Snake game with Pygame
(https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/) 


 Summary:
  This article is a tutorial on how to create the classic game of Snake
  using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The 
  author begins by explaining the game's rules and objectives before 
  diving into the implementation details. The tutorial covers creating 
  the game's graphics, handling user input, implementing the game logic, 
  and adding sound effects to the game.

 Evaluation:
  This is a very technical article that will help us with utilizing 
  pygame, the python package focused on building games, to implement 
  our own game of snake to test our neural network on.

 
3) How to teach an ai to play games 
(https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-an-ai-to-play-games-deep-reinforcement-learning-28f9b920440a)


 Summary:
  Another article about using ai and reinforcement learning to play games
 
 
 4) Neural Networks (https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks)
 
 Summary:
  This article is an overview of neural networks, including their history,
  applications, and types. The article also covers the different types 
  of neural networks, including feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional
   neural networks, and their unique characteristics and use cases.

 Evaluation:
  This is a good general source for reference about neural networks.

 
 5) Neural Networks(https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414)


 Summary:
  This article describes how neural networks work. The article also 
  covers deep learning, which involves using neural networks with many
  layers to learn complex patterns and features, and gives examples of
  applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language 
  processing, and self-driving cars.

 Evaluation:
  This is another good general source for reference about neural networks.
