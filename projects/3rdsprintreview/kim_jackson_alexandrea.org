* Abstract
#+begin_example
       Artificial intelligence art is art created through the assistance of
artificial intelligence programs. AI art can encompass music
compositions (Civit/Cuadrado, 2022), poetry (Hitsuwari, 2022), and
digital works of art. Of these, text-to-image AI has become
increasingly popular. In 2021, OpenAI’s advanced neural network DALL-E
made waves in the AI art world (Ramesh/Pavlov/Gray, 2021). As AI art
generators become more advanced, discussion over “authorship,
copyright, and ethical issues” grows (Cetinic/She, 2022). Critics of
AI art also highlight failure of AI to capture a vision and ease of
production and thus lack of artistic skill.  Here we document and show
that AI art can be incorporated into the medium of clay and continue
to hold the artistic form and vision of the artist. We use an AI art
generator called NightCafe and enter text that the generator turns
into images. Then, we print and cut the design onto a vinyl sticker
and transfer the image over through cyanotyping, a process of printing
which uses sunlight (Ware).  
       What this reveals in relation to what was thought previously. AICAN
(artiﬁcial intelligence creative adversarial network) system is
designed to deviate from copying the images they learn from and to
instead encourage new versions of art (Audry/Ippolito, 2019). 
       AI art ideally is used as part of the process and not taken as the
final product. AI art in itself is its own medium the likes of which
we have never really seen before in human history, and therefore
should be used as such. In a few hundred years and strictly in terms
of art prowess, future humans may look back on our time similarly to
how we look upon the Renaissance. Ultimately, there is unlimited
potential for collaborative artwork between AI and humans.
